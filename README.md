Ahmed Kamal – Cybersecurity Analyst
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Ahmed Kamal, a dedicated and passionate cybersecurity analyst with a focus on identifying vulnerabilities, strengthening defenses, and ensuring the security of digital systems. With hands-on experience in threat hunting, vulnerability assessment, risk management, and security operations, I specialize in finding innovative solutions to address security challenges. My goal is to help organizations create robust security frameworks that safeguard their data, systems, and networks from evolving cyber threats.

Key Skills:
Threat Detection and Response : Expertise in analyzing and detecting cyber threats, including malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks. I have practical experience with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
  
 Vulnerability Assessment : Proficient in conducting vulnerability assessments using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Burp Suite. I have experience identifying potential risks and working with development teams to mitigate them.
  
 Penetration Testing : Skilled in simulating attacks and identifying weaknesses in networks and applications. I’ve worked with frameworks like Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Burp Suite to perform controlled penetration tests, helping organizations understand their security gaps.

 Security Operations & Monitoring : Experienced in the use of SIEM platforms like Splunk, LogRhythm, and ELK stack to monitor, analyze, and respond to security incidents in real-time. 

 Risk Management : Strong understanding of risk assessment models and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001) to identify potential security threats, quantify risks, and develop strategies to mitigate those risks.

 Cryptography & Data Protection : Knowledge of encryption techniques, secure protocols, and how to protect data at rest and in transit. Familiar with SSL/TLS, AES, and RSA for ensuring data confidentiality.

 Security Best Practices : Deep understanding of the importance of secure software development practices, regular patch management, and creating incident response plans to ensure minimal damage in case of a breach.

  Tools & Technologies:
 Operating Systems : Linux (Kali, Ubuntu), Windows, macOS
 Security Tools : Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nessus, Nmap, Nikto, Aircrack-ng
 SIEM Platforms : Splunk, ELK Stack, LogRhythm
 Programming/Scripting Languages : Python, Bash, PowerShell, SQL
 Cloud Security : AWS, Azure Security
 Compliance Standards : NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA

  Projects & Contributions:
On this GitHub, you will find repositories containing security tools, scripts, and research projects that I have worked on. These include:

 Security Automation Scripts : Automating vulnerability scanning, network traffic analysis, and incident response using Python and Bash.
 Penetration Testing Tools : Custom tools for penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, and data exfiltration simulations.
 Educational Content : Tutorials and guides for beginners looking to get into cybersecurity. These include topics such as secure coding practices, setting up firewalls, and creating incident response plans.
 Collaborations & Open Source : I actively contribute to open-source cybersecurity projects and collaborate with other professionals to improve security standards and tools.

  My Approach to Cybersecurity:
I believe that cybersecurity is a continuous journey and requires constant learning and adaptation. My approach combines proactive measures such as threat hunting and penetration testing, with reactive techniques like incident response and forensics to ensure comprehensive security. I’m always on the lookout for emerging threats and new techniques to safeguard systems and data.

I am a strong advocate of collaboration and open-source contributions, as I believe that collective knowledge sharing drives innovation in the cybersecurity field. This GitHub serves as a place to share my experiences, tools, and resources with fellow cybersecurity professionals and anyone looking to learn more about security.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or if you have any questions regarding cybersecurity topics. Let’s work together to build a safer, more secure digital world.
